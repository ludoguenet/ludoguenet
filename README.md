# Hey, I'm Ludovic!

### I'm the creator of [Laravel Jutsu 🥷](https://laraveljutsu.net). You can [have a look](https://www.youtube.com/@LaravelJutsu)!

Recently, I joined [Epekta](https://epekta.com) as Software Engineer 🪐. This whole journey began with the creation of my YouTube channel to share my modest knowledge in PHP 🤏. Since then, I've been sharing my knowledge and creating incredible applications in PHP and JS with Laravel and Vue.
