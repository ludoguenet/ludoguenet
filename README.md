# Hello, I'm Ludovic!

### Full-stack Developer with a Passion for Laravel & Vue

I'm currently contributing to the [Epekta](https://epekta.com) team as a Full-stack Developer, working remotely. My journey started with a YouTube channel where I shared PHP knowledge, and it has since evolved into crafting robust web applications with Laravel and Vue.
