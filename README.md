# Hi, I'm Ludovic!

### I'm a Software Engineer, specialising in web application development with Laravel and Vue.

Recently, I joined [Epekta](https://epekta.com) as a Full-stack Developer 🪐. My current role allows me to work remotely from home 🏠.

This journey began with the creation of my YouTube channel to modestly share my knowledge in PHP 🤏. Since then, I've actively shared my expertise and crafted incredible applications in PHP and JS using Laravel and Vue.

## About Me

I specialise in designing web products with Laravel and Vue. As the creator of the Laravel Jutsu project, my goal is to give the deserved momentum to these frameworks within the British tech community.
